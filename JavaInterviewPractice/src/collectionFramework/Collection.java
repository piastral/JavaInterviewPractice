package collectionFramework;
/*the collection in java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulates the group of object
 * any group of individual objects which are represented as single unit is knows ast collection 
 * in java separate framework named collection framework has been defined in jdk 1.2'
 * the collection interface(java.util.collection) and map interface(java.util.map) are thwo main root 
 * interfaces of java collection classes
 * what is framework? 
 * a framework is set of classes and interfaces which provide a ready made architecture .in order to implement a 
 * new feature or a class there is no need to define a framework
 * java collection framework includes the following 
 * 1-interfaces 
 * 2-classes
 * 
 * LIST INTERFACE :-list interface i   s the child interface of the collection interface .it inhibits a list type data structure
 * in whcih we can store the ordered collection of objects .it can have duplicate values
 * list interfaces is implemented by the classes Arraylist; Linked LIst;Vector;and Stack
 * to instantiate the list interface we must use:
 * 1-list<datatype> list 1 = new ArrayList();
 * 2-list<datatype> list 2 = new LinkedList()  
 * 3-list<datatype> list 3 = new Vector();
 * 4list<datatype> list 4 = new Stack ();
 * 
 * ARRAYLIST :-- arraylist class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements.it is like array but there is no size limit
 * we can add or remove elements anytime.
 * arraylist can have duplicate elemts.
 * it implements list interface so we can use all the method of the list interface here .it maintains the insertion
 * order internally it is found in java.util
 * bullet points
 * 1- arraylist can contain duplicate elements
 * 2-arraylist class maintains insertion order
 * 3-arraylist class we can use get and set methods
 * 4-arraylist allows random access because the array works on index basis
 * 5-arraylist class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements inital capacity will be 10
