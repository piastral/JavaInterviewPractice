	 * 
	 * note:-As a developer if we want to develop 100 buttons we are not writing code for every button individually 
	 * first we are creating class with variables and methods and by using class we creating objects whenever we required
	 * 
	 * OBJECT :- objects are the instance of class that means if we want to access the instance members of the class
	 * we need to create the reference object so that with the help of object we can access instance members
	 * 
	 * PACKAGE : package is collection of classes and interface there are 2 different packages available in java
