/*like a class ,an interface can have methods and variables but the methods declared in interface are by default
 * abstract(only method signature ,no body)
 *  interface is a collection of abstract methods
 *  interfaces specify what class must do and now how .it is blueprint of class
 *  
 *  to declare an interface ,use interface keyword,it is used to provide total abstraction that means all the methods
 *  in  interface are declared with empty body and are public by default
 *  
 *  a class that implement interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface .to 
 *  implements interface
 *  use "implements" keyword
 *  unimplemented meaning:::::no body or no signature 
 *  implemented menaing ::: having body in am method or local variable in method
