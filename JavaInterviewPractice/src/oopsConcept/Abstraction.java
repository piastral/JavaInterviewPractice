/*Abstraction :- Representing essential features by hiding background details is called abstraction
 * data abstraction :- is the property by virtue of which only the essentials details are displayed to the user .the trivial or the non essentials units are not 
 * displayed to the user .
 * ex :- a car is viewed as car rather than its individual components 
 * Data Abstraction : may also be defines as the process of identifying only the required charc of an object ignoring 
 * the irrelevant details .the properties and behaviors of an object differentiate  it from other objects of similar
 * type and also helps in classifying /grouping objects.
 * 
 * HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE ABSTARCTION:
 * abstraction can be achieve by two types 
 * 
 * 1-Abstract class and Abstract methods 
 * 
 * 2-AN abstract class is class thats is declared with "abstract" keyword
 * 
 * 3- An abstract methods is method that is declared without an "IMPLEMENTATION"
 * 
 * 4- An abstract class may or may not have all abstracts methods some of them can be "CONCRETE METHODS " * 
 * 
 * 5- A method defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass thus making overriding compulsory Or either
 * make subclass itself abstract
 * 
 *6- Any class thats contains one or more abstract method must also be declared with abstract keyword
 *
 * 7-there can be no object of an abstract class that is, abstract class can not be directly instantiated with
 * the "NEW"operator
 *
