/*INHERTANCE:::- the idea behind inheritance in java is that you create new classes that are built upon existing classes
 * ,you can reuse methods and fields  ,variables  of the parent class,moreover you can add new method and fields in 
 * your current class also
 * 
 * inheritance represents the IS-A RELATIONSHIP which is also know as parent-child relationship
 * inheritance : it defines the behavior (members) of one class to another class
 * child class object will inherit the properties of parent class
 * java supports 4 diff types of Inheritance
 * 
 * 1- Single Inheritance
 * 2-multilevel ;;
 * 3 hierarchical ;;
 * 4-hybrid ;;
 * 
 * SINGLE INHEIRTANCE:- in this we ARE INHERTING the behavior from one class to another class(Parent to child)
 * note: inheritance we can inherit the behavior of one class to another class by using "EXTEND" keyword
 * 	
 * 
 * MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE: WE ARE INHERITAING properties from one class to another and into another class 
 * (GRAND PARENTS TO PARENT AND PARENT TO CHILD )
 * 
 * HIERARCHICAL INHERTIANCE ::: one father two child , we can inherit the behavior from one class to multiple class
 * 
 *HYBRID INHERTANCE :: WE CAN INHERIT the behaviour from one class to another class into another class
 *Multiple inheritance :: java does not support multiple inheritance with classes but it supports multiple inheritance with 
 *interface ;is the ability for a class to inherit behaviours from multiple types how ever java desnt support 
 *
 *this keyword points to current method variable like only for child
 *super keyword points to parent variable
