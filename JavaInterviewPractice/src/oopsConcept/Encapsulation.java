/*Encapsulation :-- is defined as the wrapping up of data under single unit .it is the mechanism that binds together code
 * and the data it manipulates.Other way to think about encapsulation is ,it is a protective shield that prevents the 
 * data from being accessed by the code outside shield
 * 
 * as in encapsulation the data in a class is hidden from other class.
 * 
 * Encapsulation can be achieved by : Declaring all the variables in the class as a private and writing public methods
 * in the class and set and get the values of variables
 * 
 * we use get method returns the variable value and the set method can be use to set the value
 * Since we are achieving encapsulation the variables must be private now generally if we want to access those variables
 * we have to use getter method which in turn will call the value of the private variable and we can set the value of the
 * private variable to modify outside the class we use getter and setter
 *
