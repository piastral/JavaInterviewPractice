/*POLYMORPHISM :- IN JAVA IS  concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways polymorphysim mean many form
 * or many phases 
 * two types of polymorphism in java :compile -time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism we can perform polymorphism in
 * java by method overloading and method overriding .
 * 
 * 1- method overloading /compile-time polymorphism/static time poly :- in a class we can have multiple methods/function with same name to access the methods we use
 * different sets of arguments in methods ,so that when we call the methods it can be easily called with the help of arguments this 
 * is we called method overloading ...compiler will identify the methods based on the arguments 
 * 
 * 2- method overriding /RUN TIME POLYMorphism ::-in methods overriding we are creating multiple methods with same 
 * name and same arguments .in this we are creating the same method name with same arguments with inheritance and sub class methods
 *  will be overriding super class methods 
 *  NOTE:-java supports method overloading and method overriding and constructor overloading but does not support 
 *  constructor overriding.
 *  method overriding can be achieve only thru inheritance   
 *  
 *  Interview Question? 
 *  why and when to use inheritance and polymorphism ??
 *  ans := it is useful for code reusability : reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class
