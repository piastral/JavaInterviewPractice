/*Java is general purpose programming language as we cans ay in this 
 * because with java we can develop any type of application
 * for ex: webapplication 
 * ...
 * java supports object oriented programming
 *
 *also java is platform  independent 
 * can you elaborate me whaat do you mean by platform independent >>
 * when we are executing our java prgram it crate the byte class which in turns 
 * 
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * lets say we have one java program 
 * which is name as demo.java which contains (source code)
 * --> which gets convert into java.class(byte code )  (COMPILER CONVERTS TO .JAVA TO .CLASS FILE)
 * --->
 * 
 * 
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * What is PLATFOMR INDEPENDENT 
 * ans:: we can run  the byte code on  any oepration system 
 * can you elaborate ??
 * lets say we have written our java program in windows and it got compiled by compiler and generated 
 * byte code which is .class format now we want to run th same program lets SAY on different machine 
 * and that machine support linux or mac as OS in that case we can easily import that byte code in the new 
 * system and than JVM has class loader which loads the  bytecode into memory and also we verify the 
 * byte code with the help of byte code verifier that is tehrer in JVM AND EVERYTHNGIS 
 * GOOD THAN JVM executed using interpreter
 * 
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * INTERPRETER::
 * interpreter reads and transalted the bytecode instructions into machine code 
 * that can be executed directly by underlying hardware process happens at runtime
 * SECURITY :: jvm can verify the bytecoede before execution ,ensuirng that it does not 
 * violate any security contrauinrts 
 * 
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * 
 * that why java is used widely because of its platform indepndent feature 
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 
 * 
 * 
 * in scalibilty : java object oriented natura is easy for developers 
 * to scale their applications vertically or horizontally 
 * 

 * 	
 * 
 * What is JDK ,JVM ,JRE ?
 * ANS::JVM 
 * Jvm stands for java virtual machine 
 * it has class loader ::whihc loads byte code into memory 
 * it has bytecodeverifier :: it verify the bytecode for security constraints 
 * also it has MEMORY AREAS 
 * ANS:: allocation of memory eg variables,
 * which is 1-STATIC 
 * 2-HEAP
 * 3-Method
 * INTERPRETER IS ALSO INSIDE JVM
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 * and execution engine and interpreter the work of this execution engine is 
 * it execute bytecode and convert into machne code exeuction engine with the help of INTERPRETER 
 * CONVERTS BYTE CODE ---->MACHINE CODE 
 * ALSO jvm has 
 * JIT AND GARBAGE COLLECTION 
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 
 * JRE :: JAVA RUNTIME ENVIROMENT 
 * it has pre-defined classes ,interfaces 
 * for example systemclass which helps us to run the java code it is there in jre 
 * JRE ALSO provide jar files 
 * jar files : collection of .class files 
 * JRE ALSO PROVIDE APIS predefined code
 * JVM IS ALSO PART OF JRE 
 * 
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * JDK :: compiler is part of jdk
 * jdk is used to execute java program 
 * so the analogy is 
 * jvm is part of JRE ...in turns jre is Part of  jdk 
 * this is the whole flow of java program from compiler to interpreter works like this
 *
