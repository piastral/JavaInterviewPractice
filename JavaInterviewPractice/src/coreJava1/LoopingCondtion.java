 * 
 * 		 we are using 3 different looping statement 
 * 1.for loop (initialization;condition;increment/decrement)
 * 2 for each loop
 * 3. while loop
 * 
 * nested for loop we are inserting one for loop inside another for loop .exectuiton starts always 
 * from main loop it goes to sub loop complete the sub loop all the iteration and than it comes 
 * bak to main loop
 * 
 * for(intitll;condition;incr/dec){
 *    for( same as avobe or can be changed ){
 *    }
